### Haskell Katas

As I try to learn Haskell, I realized reading and following examples is not enough, I needed short examples I could practice daily.

The examples in this repo are mostly from the book [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/), although I started incorporating other examples as well.

The `master` branch has all the exercises, all the pending tests you need to work on. The [solutions](https://github.com/adomokos/haskell_katas/tree/solutions) branch has the incomplete examples you need to implement.

You need [HSpec](https://hspec.github.io/) installed globally to run the examples.

The IO examples are in the [test/io](https://github.com/adomokos/haskell_katas/tree/master/test/io) directory.

Enjoy!
